Each of the electronic control units, as well as a memory unit, are connected to an internal data link of the vehicle. When a parameter value within the memory unit corresponding to a given control unit is changed, a message is provided to the base station specifying the value currently registered by the control unit. The currently registered value is then compared to an expected parameter value, and an error message is generated if disagreement exists therebetween. The system also allows vehicle control unit parameter settings to be adjusted from a remote location such as a base station. The MCT of each vehicle is disposed to generate message packets containing updated control unit parameter information received from the base station. The message packets are then sent to a selected electronic control unit over the data link, thereby allowing the updated control unit parameter information to be loaded therein.";"Doyle Thomas F [US]";NULL;"US5815071A";"1998-09-29";"US19960766217";"1996-12-12";NULL;NULL;"B60K31/00; B60R16/02; B62D41/00; F02D29/02; F02D45/00; G07C5/00; G08G1/09; G08G1/123; G08G1/13; H04B7/26; B60R16/03";"B60K 31/0058; B60K 31/0058; B60R 16/02; G07C 5/008; G07C 5/008; G08G 1/202; G08G 1/202; B60R 16/0315; B60R 16/0315";"0";NULL;NULL;NULL;NULL;"0"
