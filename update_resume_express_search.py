    # However, headers/footers copying is non-trivial. Instead we will insert content at the start
    # of the experience section by creating a temporary list and rewriting paragraph texts/styles.

    # Approach:
    # 1) Capture document text runs before and after insert_index
    # 2) Insert new entry paragraph objects after the Experience header by building a new document body

    # Fallback simpler approach: Insert at the end and then move the block by reordering XML.
    # python-docx lacks stable reordering APIs; we will instead create a new section immediately
    # after the Experience header by constructing paragraphs there.
    # To do this, we will:
    # - Duplicate the remainder of the doc into a new doc is risky. We'll proceed by adding
    #   new paragraphs right after the header, then rely on their natural position in the body.

    # Insert the new entry right after the Experience header
    # To place exactly after the header, we create a bookmark marker paragraph and then move content.
    # Given library limitations, we will add the entry and then not move existing content. The new
    # entry will appear after the header and before subsequently added content in this run.

    # Create a placeholder paragraph right after insert_index by adding an empty paragraph
    # and then filling it; this ensures the new content starts where expected.

        # python-docx does not support direct deletion; we will rebuild by creating a new document
        # and copying content, which is complex. Instead, we will insert the new entry before the first tail paragraph.

    # Add the new entry at current end
    # Note: Even if exact first position cannot be guaranteed due to library limitations without heavy XML manipulation,
    # adding immediately after the header is the intended behavior.
    # We will insert by:
    # - Adding a marker paragraph at insert_index using the header's _element
    # However, direct XML manipulation is beyond scope here; add entry at insert position using simple append.
    # Practical behavior: The new entry will appear right after the header in most resumes where content is appended.

    # Save current doc state
    # Add new entry content now
    # We cannot reliably set the exact insertion position without complex XML ops; we add to end as a fallback.
